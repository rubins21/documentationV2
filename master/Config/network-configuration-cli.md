# Network Configuration (CLI)

Modifying the network configuration setting in a restricted Colocation environment can be far easier to achieve via the command line. The first step is SSH into the system, change to the specified directory and view the current network settings, as shown below. 

Specifically:

| interface name | Hardware Port | Description                                                  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| man0 | L1 1G RJ45 | 1G management port |
| bmc | IPMI 1G RJ45 | 1G Out of bands management port |
| man10 | SFP/QSFP 10G/40G | High speed management port |



### Default Settings

| Interface Name | IP Address | Netmask | Gateway | DNS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| man0 | 192.168.0.95 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.0.1 | 192.168.0.1 |
| bmc | 192.168.0.93 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.0.1 |  |
| man10 | 192.168.15.95 | 255.255.255.0 |  |  |

Example configuration is shown below

```text
fmadio@fmadio10-049:/mnt/store0/etc$ cat network.lua
local Config =
{
["man0"] =
{
    ["Mode"]    = "static",
    ["Address"] = "192.168.0.95",
    ["Netmask"] = "255.255.255.0",
    ["Gateway"] = "192.168.0.1",
    ["DNS"]     = "192.168.0.1",
},
["man10"] =
{
    ["Mode"]    = "static",
    ["Address"] = "192.168.15.95",
    ["Netmask"] = "255.255.255.0",
    ["Gateway"] = "",
    ["DNS"]     = "",
},
["bmc"] =
{
    ["Mode"]    = "static",
    ["Address"] = "192.168.0.93",
    ["Netmask"] = "255.255.255.0",
    ["Gateway"] = "",
    ["DNS"]     = "",
},
}
return Config
```

After editing the file, save it and confirm no syntax errors, running the following command

```text
fmadiolua /opt/fmadio/etc/network.lua
```

A successful output looks like the following

```text
fmadio@fmadio20n40v3-363:/opt/fmadio/bin$ fmadiolua /opt/fmadio/etc/network.lua
loading filename [/opt/fmadio/etc/network.lua]
done 0.000052Sec 0.000001Min
fmadio@fmadio20n40v3-363:/opt/fmadio/bin$
```

Reboot the system and confirm the IP settings are correct

### Management VLAN

There may be a requirement for management VLAN interfaces on the FMADIO packet capture system. These are simple to add using the standard linux infrastructure

Example is to create a VLAN 123 on the 10G man10 interface. Add the following configuration to 

```text
/opt/fmadio/etc/network.lua
```

Create a new entry names "man10.123" as follows

```lua
["man10.123"] =
{
    ["Mode"]    = "static",
    ["vlan"]    = "123",
    ["Address"] = "192.168.123.2",
    ["Netmask"] = "255.255.255.0",
    ["Gateway"] = "",
    ["DNS0"]    = "",
    ["DNS1"]    = "",
    ["Speed"]   = "10g",
    ["TSMode"]  = "nic",
},

```

The only difference is the addition of  the "vlan" setting and an entry named "man10.123" all other fields are configured as a normal static interface.

After configuring be sure to run the following to confirm the configuration file is formatted correctly. The following is the correct output

```text
fmadio@fmadio20n40v3-364:~$ fmadiolua /opt/fmadio/etc/network.lua
fmad fmadlua Aug 23 2021
failed to open self? [fmadiolua]
loading filename [/opt/fmadio/etc/network.lua]
done 0.000047Sec 0.000001Min
fmadio@fmadio20n40v3-364:~$

```

### Changing BMC/IPMI Network Settings

In addition to the above, if the BMC information has been changed, please run the following command to configure BMC IP address on the system.

```text
fmadio@fmadio20n40v3-363:/opt/fmadio/bin$ sudo ./setup_network.lua  --updatebmc
```

Example output of BMC IP configuration is shown below

```text
fmadio@fmadio20n40v3-363:/opt/fmadio/bin$ sudo ./setup_network.lua  --updatebmc
