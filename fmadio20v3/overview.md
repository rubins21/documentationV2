# Introduction

#### FMADIO 20G Gen3

The FMADIO 20G packet capture device is our entry level full sustained line rate 10Gbit capture to cache packet capture / packet sniffer devices. It is a compact 1U 650mm deep chassis featuring 3.2 nanosecond resolution hardware packet time stamps and sub 100ns world time accuracy via PTPv2 and PPS. 

In addition there is 1-4TB of high bandwidth SSD flash storage which is written back into 16-64TB of raw magnetic disk drives. The system is unique by combining a hybrid SSD / HDD storage architecture to gain maximum cost savings with maximum disk storage and still be capable of sustained up to 4TB worth of line rate capture without any packet drops.
